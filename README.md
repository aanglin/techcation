## Description
This was a get back to basics approach to making a landing page. I started with researching different sites to model the landing page. I found (Clint)code commerce channel on youtube and decided to base it on that style. I then created a prototype for the landing page using figma. I then coded the landing page. I made some  changes to the landing page from the prototype and it looks more appealing. I have a better understanding of Next.js and Tailwind and look forward to learn more about these technologies.
